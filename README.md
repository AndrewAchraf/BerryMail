## Design Pattern used:
#### Builder Design Pattern:
- Used to create an object of type User and type Mail with different number of attributes .
#### Singleton Design Pattern:
- Used in order to make sure that there exists only one instance of the user .
#### Mediator Design Pattern:
- Used to reduce dependencies between objects and restricts direct communications between these objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object (User Service has the ability to communicate with Mail Service) .
#### Filter Design Pattern:
-  Used simply to implement features of each type of filter .
#### Factory Design Pattern:
-  Used to make factory for the filter criterias. The Filter Factory class creates an instance of any filter by using a key string which is the name of the desired filter to be formed .
